# TableSegueing
Small bit of code for segueing from a tableView into another tableView.
This bit of code is taken from Ben Sullivan's course Mastering table views, where he explains how to segue from tableView to another 
tableView by using Object Oriented Programming. The code is very straight forward and uses a struct.
10/10 to Ben.
